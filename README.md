## Description
This project forms part of Udacity's Front End Web Developer nanodegree.

The purpose is to create a suite of tests for an existing application using the Jasmine testing framework.
The application in question is feed reader provided by Udacity.
Users get presented with a list of feeds at load and they can either elect to click on one of the links to read the article or
select another feed from left-hand menu.


The tests run when the page loads.



## How to install
To obtain the files in this directory, you can either fork the repository in your own directory or download a zip file to your own machine and extract it. Either way, you should have the unzipped folder on your machine to be able to run it.

You will find the following files:
* README.md: this file
* index.html: the html page containing the feed reader
* app.js: the JavaScript code handling the actual feed reader
* feedreader.js: the code utilising the Jasmine framework to handle tests
* Screenshot.png: a screenshot used for github.

Other:
* css: folder containing css files
* fonts: folder containing font fles
* jasmine: folder containing the files used by the Jasmine framework 

Once this is done, you can open index.html in your browser.
